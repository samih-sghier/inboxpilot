## Use of Gmail OAuth

Inboxpilot uses Gmail OAuth to access your Gmail account with the necessary permissions to send and read emails. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your data. Here's how we handle your Gmail data:

- **Email Access**: We use Gmail OAuth to access your emails solely for the purpose of generating AI responses. We do not store your emails on our servers.
- **Data Storage**: The only data we store is the AI-generated response that is sent out, along with message IDs and thread IDs. This is stored for logging purposes to help improve our services and ensure accountability.
- **Data Security**: All data interactions with Gmail are encrypted and handled securely. We adhere to industry-standard security practices to protect your information.
- **No Email Storage**: We do not store, read, or analyze your emails beyond what is necessary to generate a response. Once the response is generated and sent, we do not retain any email content.
- **User Control**: You can revoke Inboxpilot's access to your Gmail account at any time through your Google account settings.
